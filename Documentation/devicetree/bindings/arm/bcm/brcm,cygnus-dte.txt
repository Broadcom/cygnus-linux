Broadcom Cygnus DTE Digital Timing Engine device tree bindings

The DTE block allows for hardware timestamping of network packets,
audio/video samples and/or GPIO inputs in a common adjustable time base.

Required SoC Specific Properties:
- compatible: should be "brcm,cygnus-dte"

- reg: Requires two separate register sets
	Base address of the Audio EAV Regsiters for DTE block and length of memory
	mapped region.

- interrupts: The DTE interrupt number to the cpu.

Example:

/ {
	dte: dte@0x180af000 {
		compatible = "brcm,cygnus-dte";
		reg = <0x180af000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 144 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;

	};
};
