* Broadcom STB NAND Controller

The Broadcom STB NAND controller utilizes the MTD subsystem to provide generic
access to NAND flash chips. This controller is available on a variety of SoCs,
and exists in several similar (but not fully register compatible) versions.

Required properties:
- compatible       : should contain "brcm,brcmnand" and an appropriate version
                      compatibility string, like "brcm,brcmnand-v7.0"
- reg              : the register start and length for NAND and (if present)
                      FLASH_DMA blocks
- reg-names        : a list of the names corresponding to the previous register
		     ranges. Should contain "nand" and (if FLASH_DMA is
                     available) "flash-dma".
- interrupts       : The NAND CTLRDY interrupt and (if Flash DMA is available)
                     FLASH_DMA_DONE
- interrupt-names  : May be "nand_ctlrdy" or "flash_dma"done"
- interrupt-parent : The phandle to the HIF L2 interrupt controller node
- #address-cells   : <1> - subnodes give the chip-select number
- #size-cells      : <0>

Optional properties:
- brcm,nand-has-wp          : Some versions of this IP include a write-protect
			      (WP) control bit. It is always available on >=
			      v7.0. Use this property to describe the rare
                              earlier versions of this core that include WP

Each controller (compatible: "brcm,brcmnand") may contain one or more subnodes
to represent enabled chip-selects which (may) contain NAND flash chips. Their
properties are as follows.

Required properties:
- compatible            : should contain "brcm,nandcs"
- reg                   : a single integer representing the chip-select number
                          (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.)
- #address-cells        : see partition.txt
- #size-cells           : see partition.txt
- nand-ecc-strength     : see nand.txt
- nand-ecc-step-size    : must be 512 or 1024. See nand.txt

Optional properties:
- nand-on-flash-bbt         : boolean, to enable the on-flash BBT for this
                              chip-select. See nand.txt
- brcm,nand-oob-sector-size : integer, TBD

Each nandcs device node may optionally contain sub-nodes describing the flash
partition mapping. See partition.txt for more detail.

Example:

nand@f0442800 {
	compatible = "brcm,brcmnand-v7.0", "brcm,brcmnand";
	reg = <0xF0442800 0x600>,
	      <0xF0443000 0x100>;
	reg-names = "nand", "flash-dma";
	interrupt-parent = <&hif_intr2_intc>;
	interrupts = <24>, <4>;

	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	nandcs@1 {
		compatible = "brcm,nandcs";
		reg = <1>; // Chip select 1
		nand-on-flash-bbt;
		nand-ecc-strength = <12>;
		nand-ecc-step-size = <512>;

		// Partitions
		#address-cells = <1>;  // <2>, for 64-bit offset
		#size-cells = <1>;     // <2>, for 64-bit length
		flash0.rootfs@0 {
			reg = <0 0x10000000>;
		};
		flash0@0 {
			reg = <0 0>; // MTDPART_SIZ_FULL
		};
		flash0.kernel@10000000 {
			reg = <0x10000000 0x400000>;
		};
	};
};
