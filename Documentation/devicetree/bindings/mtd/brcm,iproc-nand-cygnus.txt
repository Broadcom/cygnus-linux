IPROC NAND controller

Required properties:
  - compatible : Should be "brcm,iproc-nand-nsp" or "brcm,iproc-nand-cygnus".
  - reg : The registers location and length for nand_regs, nand_idm_regs and
	  optionally nand_strap_regs.
  - interrupts : The interrupt number.

Optional properties:
- #chip-selects : Number of chip selects. If not present, it defaults to 1.
- wp-mode : Write protect mode. If not present, it defaults to 1.
		0 - WP is not used or not available
		1 - WP is set by default, cleared for erase/write operations
		2 - WP is always cleared
- timing-mode : Maximum ONFI timing mode allowed (0-5).
		If not present, it defaults to power-on timing configuration
- hw-auto-init : Perform controller auto configuration
- corr-threshold-percent : The percentage of the BCH ECC correction capability
			   from which correctable errors will be reported.
			   If not present, it defaults to 60%.

Examples:

	nand: nand@0x18046000 {
		compatible = "brcm,iproc-nand-cygnus";
		reg = nand_regs: <0x18046000 0x1000>,
		      nand_idm_regs: <0xf8105000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 69 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#chip-selects = <1>;
		wp-mode = <1>;
		timing-mode = <5>;
	};
