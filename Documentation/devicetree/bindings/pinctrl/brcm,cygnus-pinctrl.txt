Broadcom Cygnus Pin Controller

The Cygnus pin controller supports setting the alternate functions of groups
of pins. Pinmux configuration on individual pins is not supported by the
Cygnus A0 SoC.

Required properties:

- compatible:
    Must be "brcm,cygnus-pinctrl"

- reg:
    Define the base and range of the I/O address space that contain the Cygnus
pin control registers

- brcm,groups:
    This can be strings of one or more group names. This defines the group(s)
that one wants to configure

- brcm,function:
    This is the alternate function that one wants to configure to. Valid
alternate functions are "alt1", "alt2", "alt3", "alt4"

Each child node represents a configuration. Client devices reference the the
child node to enable the mux configuration.

For example:

	pinctrl: pinctrl@0x0301d0c8 {
		compatible = "brcm,cygnus-pinctrl";
		reg = <0x0301d0c8 0x2c>;

		i2s_0: i2s_0 {
			brcm,groups = "smart_card0", "smart_card0_fcb";
			brcm,function = "alt2";
		};

		i2s_1: i2s_1 {
			brcm,groups = "smart_card1", "smart_card1_fcb";
			brcm,function = "alt2";
		};

		spi_0: spi_0 {
			brcm,groups = "spi0";
			brcm,function = "alt1";
		};
	}

	spi0@18028000 {
			compatible = "arm,pl022", "arm,primecell";
			reg = <0x18028000 0x1000>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 78 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			pinctrl-0 = <&spi_0>;
			clocks = <&axi81_clk>;
			clock-names = "apb_pclk";
	};

Consider the following snapshot of Cygnus pinmux table:

number    pin            group              alt1             alt2        alt3        alt4
------    ---            ----               ----             ----        ----        ----
42        sc0_clk        smart_card0        SMART CARD0      I2S_0       N/A         chip_gpio24
43        sc0_cmdvcc_l   smart_card0        SMART CARD0      I2S_0       N/A         STRAP
44        sc0_detect     smart_card0        SMART CARD0      I2S_0       N/A         chip_gpio25
45        sc0_fcb        smart_card0_fcb    SMART CARD0_FCB  I2S_0       N/A         chip_gpio26
46        sc0_io         smart_card0        SMART CARD0      I2S_0       N/A         chip_gpio27
47        sc0_rst_l      smart_card0        SMART CARD0      SPDIF       N/A         STRAP

Note due to limitation of the Cygnus hardware, pinmux configuration can only
be group based. To enable I2S_0 function, one needs the following child node
configuration:

	i2s_0: i2s_0 {
		brcm,groups = "smart_card0", "smart_card0_fcb";
		brcm,function = "alt2";
	};

This tells the Cygnus pin controller to configure groups "smart_card0" and
"smart_card0_fcb" to I2S_0. With this configuration, pins 42, 43, 44, 45, 46
become I2S_0, and pin 47 becomes SPDIF

Consider another example, that one wants to configure the above pins as GPIO:

	gpio_24_27: gpio_24_27 {
		brcm,groups = "smart_card0", "smart_card0_fcb";
		brcm,function = "alt4";
	};

With the above configuration, pins 42, 44, 45, 46 become GPIO, and 43 and 47
become reserved for STRAP
