* Broadcom's IPROC Touchscreen Controller

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "brcm,iproc-touchscreen"
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- clocks:  The clock provided by the SOC to driver the tsc
- clock-name:  name for the clock
- interrupts: The touchscreen controller's interrupt

Optional properties:
- scanning_period: Time between scans. Each step is 1024 us.  Valid 1-256.
- debounce_timeout: Each step is 512 us.  Valid 0-255
- settling_timeout: The settling duration (in ms) is the amount of time
                    the tsc waits to allow the voltage to settle after
                    turning on the drivers in detection mode.
                    Valid values: 0-11

                   10 =  5.12 ms
                   11 = 10.24 ms
- touch_timeout: The continuous number of scan periods in which touch is
                not detected before the controller returns to idle state.
                Valid values 0-255.
- average_data: Number of data samples which are averaged before a final
                data point is placed into the FIFO
                Valid values 0-7
                0 =   1 sample
                1 =   2 samples
                2 =   4 samples
                3 =   8 samples
                4 =  16 samples
                5 =  32 samples
                6 =  64 samples
                7 = 128 samples
- fifo_threshold: Interrupt is generated whenever the number of fifo
                entries exceeds this value
                Valid values 0-31
- ts-rotation: Touch screen controller and display panel orientation angle.
		0 = Tsc x_min y_min placed at LCD x_min y_min. None
		1 = Tsc x_min y_max placed at LCD x_min y_min. 90 degrees
		2 = Tsc x_max y_max placed at LCD x_min y_min. 180 degrees
		3 = Tsc x_max y_min placed at LCD x_min y_min. 270 degrees
