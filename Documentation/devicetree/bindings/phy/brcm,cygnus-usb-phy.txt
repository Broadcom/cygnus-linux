BROADCOM CYGNUS USB PHY

Required Properties:
	- compatible:  brcm,cygnus-usb-phy
	- reg : usbphy_regs - Base address of phy registers
			usb2h_idm_regs - Base address of host idm registers
			usb2d_idm_regs - Base address of device idm registers
	 - num_phys : Number of phys available
	 - #phy-cells must be 2
The node that uses the phy must provide two integers, the first indicates the
port and the second indicates whether its host or device. The second integer
is 0 for device and 1 for host

NOTE: port 0 and port 1 are host only and port 2 can be configured for host or device.

Example of phy :
	usbphy0: usbphy@0x0301c000 {
		#phy-cells = <2>;
		num_phys = <3>;
		compatible = "brcm,cygnus-usb-phy";
		reg = <0x0301c000 0x2000>,
		      <0x18115000 0x1000>,
		      <0x18111000 0x1000>;
		status = "okay";
	};

Example of node using the phy:

	/* This nodes declares  port 0
	and port 1 as host*/

	ehci0: usb@0x18048000 {
		compatible = "generic-ehci";
		reg = <0x18048000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 72 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		phys = <&usbphy0 0 1 &usbphy0 1>;
		phy-names = "usbp0","usbp1";
		status = "okay";
	};

	/* This node declares port 2 phy
	and configures it for device */

	usbd_udc_dwc1: usbd_udc_dwc@0x1804c000 {
		compatible = "iproc-udc";
		reg = <0x1804c000 0x2000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 123 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		phys = <&usbphy0 2 0>;
		phy-names = "usb";
	};
