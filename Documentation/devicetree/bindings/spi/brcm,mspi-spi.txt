Broadcom MSPI controller

The Broadcom MSPI controller is a SPI controller found on various chips such
as Cygnus.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "brcm,mspi-v0".

- reg:  The first register is the physical base address of the MSPI controller.
  The second register is the address of the MSPI interrupt control registers. It
  is only required for chips that have a separate register set for extended
  interrupt control. This is required for Cygnus.

- interrupts: Interrupt ID of the controller.

Optional properties:
- clocks: The MSPI reference clock. If not provided then it is assumed a clock
  is enabled by default and no control of clock-frequency (see below) is
  possible.

- clock-names: The name of the reference clock.

- clock-frequency: Desired frequency of the clock. This will set the serial
  clock baud rate (SPBR) based on the reference clock frequency. The frequency
  of the SPBR is mspi_clk / (2 * SPBR) where SPBR is a value between 1-255
  determined by the desired 'clock-frequency'. If not provided then the default
  baud rate of the controller is used.

Example:

mspi: mspi@18047200 {
	compatible = "brcm,mspi-v0";
	reg = <0x18047200 0x188>,
	      <0x180473a0 0x1c>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 70 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&axi41_clk>;
	clock-names = "mspi_clk";
	clock-frequency = <12500000>;
};
