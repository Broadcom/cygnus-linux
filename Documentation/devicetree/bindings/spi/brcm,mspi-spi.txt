Broadcom MSPI controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be either "brcm,mspi" or "brcm,bcma-mspi". Use
  "brcm,bcma-mspi" for controllers on a bcma bus and "brcm,mspi" otherwise.

- reg:  Physical base address and length of the controller's registers.

- interrupts: The interrupt id for the controller.

- #address-cells: should be 1.

- #size-cells: should be 0.

Optional properties:
- clocks: The MSPI reference clock. If not provided then it is assumed a clock
  is enabled by default and no control of clock-frequency (see below) is
  possible.

- clock-names: The name of the reference clock.

- clock-frequency: Desired frequency of the clock. This will set the serial
  clock baud rate (SPBR) based on the reference clock frequency. The frequency
  of the SPBR is mspi_clk / (2 * SPBR) where SPBR is a value between 1-255
  determined by the desired 'clock-frequency'. If not provided then the default
  baud rate of the controller is used.

Example:

mspi@18047000 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "brcm,mspi";
	reg = <0x18047000 0x1000>;
	clocks = <&axi41_clk>;
	clock-names = "mspi_clk";
	clock-frequency = <12500000>;
};
