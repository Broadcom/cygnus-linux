Properties for an MDIO bus multiplexer available in Broadcom NSP SoC.

This MDIO bus multiplexer defines buses that could access the internal
phys as well as external to SoCs. When child bus is selected, one needs
to select the below properties to generate desired MDIO transaction on
appropriate bus.

Required properties in addition to the generic multiplexer properties:

MDIO multiplexer node:
- compatible: brcm,mdio-mux-iproc.
- reg: Should contain registers location and length.
- reg-names: Should contain the resource reg names.
	- bus-ctrl: mdio bus control register address space required to
	  select the bus master. This property is not required for SoC's
	  that doesn't provide master selection.
	- mgmt-ctrl: mdio management control register address space

Sub-nodes:
   Each bus master should be represented as a sub-node.

Sub-nodes required properties:
- reg: Bus master number. Should be 0x10 to access the external mdio devices.
- address-cells: should be 1
- size-cells: should be 0

Every non-ethernet PHY requires a compatible property so that it could be
probed based on this compatible string.

Additional information regarding generic multiplexer properties can be found
at- Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/mdio-mux.txt

example:

	mdio_mux: mdio-mux@3f190 {
		compatible = "brcm,mdio-mux-nsp";
		reg = <0x3f190 0x4>,
		      <0x32000 0x4>;
		reg-names = "bus-ctrl", "mgmt-ctrl";
		mdio-parent-bus = <&mdio>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		mdio@0 {
			reg = <0x0>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			usb3_phy: usb3-phy@10 {
				compatible = "brcm,nsp-usb3-phy";
				reg = <0x10>;
				usb3-ctrl-syscon = <&usb3_ctrl>;
				#phy-cells = <0>;
				status = "disabled";
			};
		};
	};
