	  Say Y here to support Broadcom BCM281xx pinctrl driver, which is used
	  for the BCM281xx SoC family, including BCM11130, BCM11140, BCM11351,
	  BCM28145, and BCM28155 SoCs.  This driver requires the pinctrl
	  framework.  GPIO is provided by a separate GPIO driver.

	  Say yes here to enable the Broadcom Cygnus IOMUX driver.

	  The Broadcom Cygnus IOMUX driver supports group based IOMUX
	  configuration, with the exception that certain individual pins
	  can be overrided to GPIO function
